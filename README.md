The following projects and exercises were conducted within my own network and virtual environment. I utilized VMware ESXi as the core platform, which I installed, patched, and configured it as a Type 1 hypervisor to support various virtual machines (VMs) and tools. Additionally, I acquired other essential equipment, including routers, switches, and various firewalls, to enhance the network infrastructure. This combination of physical hardware and virtual resources created a robust, flexible, and scalable environment that was ideal for a wide range of testing and development scenarios.
